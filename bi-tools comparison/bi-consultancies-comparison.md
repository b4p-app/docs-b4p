Let’s admit it- centralized business intelligence alone just doesn’t work


"Companies that include both top down and bottom up capabilities in their architecture will stop wasting time fighting internally, and start to take advantage of all that data."

"The existence of shadow systems, and the extent of them, is the clearest argument that centralized business intelligence alone is simply not up to the task."

Tools like Lyzasoft, our own Datamartist tool, and Microsoft's Power Pivot in Excel 2010 and others are all going to drive power to the users, and introduce a new balanced approach between centralized and local parts of business intelligence architectures. Visualization tools like Tableau will further give people the ability to create powerful, consumable analysis in a self serve mode.
